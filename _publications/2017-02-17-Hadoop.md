excerpt: 'Apache Hadoop is a predominant software framework to store and process vast amount of data, produced in varied formats. Data stored in Hadoop multi-tenant data lake often includes sensitive data such as social security numbers, intelligence sources and medical particulars, which should only be accessed by legitimate users. Apache Ranger and Apache Sentry are important authorization systems providing fine-grained access control across several Hadoop ecosystem services. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive explanation for the authorization framework offered by Hadoop ecosystem, incorporating core Hadoop 2.x native access control features and capabilities offered by Apache Ranger, with prime focus on data services including Apache Hive and Hadoop 2.x core services. A multi-layer authorization system is discussed and demonstrated, reflecting access control for services, data, applications and infrastructure resources inside a representative Hadoop ecosystem instance. A concrete use case is discussed to underline the application of aforementioned access control points. We use Hortonworks Hadoop distribution HDP 2.5 to exhibit this multi-layer access control framework.'
