excerpt: 'Embodiments of the present systems and methods may provide techniques that provide dynamic groups and attribute-based access control (ABAC) model (referred as CV-ABACG) to secure communication, data exchange and resource access in smart vehicles ecosystems. In embodiments, the model not only considers system wide attributes-based security policies, but also takes into account individual user privacy preferences for allowing or denying service notifications, alerts, and operations to on-board resources. Embodiments of the present systems and methods may provide groups in vehicular IoT, which may be dynamically assigned to moving entities like connected cars, based on their current GPS coordinates, speed or other attributes, to ensure relevance of location and time sensitive notification services, to provide administrative benefits to manage large numbers of entities, and to enable attributes inheritance for fine-grained authorization policies.'
