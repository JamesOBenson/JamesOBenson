excerpt: 'Recently Deep Learning based Access Control (DLBAC) model has been developed to reduce the burden of access control model engineering on a human administrator, while managing accurate access control state in large, complex, and dynamic systems. DLBAC utilizes neural networks for addressing access control requirements of a system based on user and resource metadata. However, in today's rapidly evolving, dynamic, and complex world with billions of connected users and devices, there are various environmental aspects in different application domains that affect access control rights and decisions. While Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) have captured environmental factors through environmental attributes, DLBAC still lacks the capabilities of capturing any environmental factors and its use in access control decision making. In this paper, we propose an environment aware deep learning based access control model (DLBAC-Env) which includes environmental metadata in addition to user and resource metadata. We present an Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) use case to demonstrate the need for DLBAC-Env and show how different types of environmental aspects in a specific domain are necessary towards making dynamic and autonomous access control decisions. We enhance the DLBAC model and dataset to incorporate environmental metadata and then implement and evaluate our DLBAC-Env model. We also present a reference implementation of DLBAC-Env in an edge cloudlet using AWS Greengrass.'
